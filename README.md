# Use case HC2 bias detection and mitigation
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook that was used to do a toy world analysis of bias detection and mitigation in the context of use case HC2 ECG data. The approach illustrates in simple ways how to use synthetic data to repair bias observed in a small data set with only few variables.
